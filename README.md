# Mobile-Development-STEPHAN-CRESSEAUX-FIEVET

## How did we work ?

Tristan managed the API calls and the filtering, where Nicolas worked on error handling and Chlo√© worked on the design and the user experience. Nicolas also made sure that there were no
errors and no warnings. 
We worked over the Christmas holidays, letting the others know when we pushed anything on Github. We communicated through Discord.

## How does our project work ?
You don't need to do anything fancy to make it work, just build it via XCode :D

## Our project

To open our app, click on the app on the IPhone that has our logo on it. This will open the first and main page, the planning of the first day. All the activities are
displayed, with the time at which it takes place. To have more information about an event, you can click on that event and you will open a new page with the name, the 
time and place of the event and the eventual speakers. You can go back to the first page. 

That first page can be filtered through the type of event and the location. It can also be filtered through the date, and this is through that that you can get the
events for the second day of the conference.
